    <h3>Gym:</h3>
    <p>My maxes(kg): bench 115x4, squat 150x4, deadlift 190x1<br>Current goal it to reach 120, 180, and 220 respectively</p>
    <p>My gym strategy: *wip*</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>Currently working on recall. My reading strategy is to create mental images as I am reading a section and at the end recall it<br>
    before moving to the next section. Also checking how well I did my recall. I am trying to create a mental image as a sequence of something.<br>
    Will report on effectivness. The goal is to recall what I read throughout the whole week or a small book. 
    </p>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>I want to improve my writing. So my strategy is: write at least one big note 100 words+ on substack notes or an article</p>
